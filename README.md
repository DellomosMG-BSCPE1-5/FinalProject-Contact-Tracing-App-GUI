# Contact Tracing App GUI using Tkinter and Openpyxl 
This Python program is a graphical user interface (GUI) for a Contact Tracing App built using the Tkinter. The app allows users to input their contact information, arrival time and date, COVID-19 vaccination status, and any COVID-19 symptoms they have experienced. The data is then saved to an Excel file for contact tracing purposes. 

### Modules Used
**Tkinter**: The standard GUI library for Python. Or you can install it using pip:
```bash
pip install tkinter
```
**Openpyxl**: Openpyxl is a library to read/write Excel files in Python. You can install it using pip:
```bash
pip install openpyxl
```
**Pathlib**

### About the App
  The app allows users to input their first name, last name, contact number, email address, and residential address. Time and date of their arrival at the premises are also needed to enter. Using the radio buttons provided by tkinter, user can select their  COVID-19 vaccination status. Checkbuttons were used, on the other hand,  to select any COVID-19 symptoms that users have experienced. 
  The app also has the search functionality that allows users to search for specific records in the Excel file based on keywords. The search results are displayed in a separate window.

## Important Note
Ensure that the Excel file "Contact Tracing Data.xlsx" is not open in any other application while running the Contact Tracing App. Otherwise, it may cause conflicts when writing data to the file.

Additionally, please make sure to respect privacy and data protection laws while using this app for contact tracing purposes.
